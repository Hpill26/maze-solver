# maze-solver

Used A-Star search methods to solve randomly generated mazes. 
Coded binary heap to traverse and store maze. 
followed forward Astar, backward Astar, and adaptive Astar to test efficiency. 
binaryheap - defines heaps for use 
mazegenerator - creates and stores random mazes
astarimplementationandheap - access random mazes from randgrid and implements different astar algos on them on specified goals and computes time efficiency of each.
