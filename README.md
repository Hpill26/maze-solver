# maze-solver

# Used A-Star search methods to solve randomly generated mazes. 
# Coded binary heap to traverse and store maze. 
# Followed forward Astar, backward Astar, and adaptive Astar to test efficiency. 
# binaryHeap - defines heaps for use 
# mazeGenerator - creates and stores random mazes
# AstarImplementationsandHeap - access random mazes from randgrid and implements different astar algos on them on specified goals and computes time efficiency of each.
